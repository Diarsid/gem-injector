# Gem Injector

It is very simple, basical, lightweight and fast Dependency Injection container based on the idea of code modularity, interfaces usage and constructor injection.

It is built using only Java Reflection API without any third-party libraries. Except for jUnit and Mockito, of course :) It is Maven-based project so if you are familiar with Maven you can take it and build into .jar by yourself.

It doesn’t have complicated and elaborated architecture, hundreds of features and so on, it is intended to be used in simple home or “pet” projects that do not require excessive complexity.
