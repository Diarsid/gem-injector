# Gem Injector


It is very simple, basical, lightweight and fast Java [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) container based on the idea of code modularity, interfaces usage and constructor injection.

  :arrow_forward: [Gem injector Tutorial](https://github.com/Diarsid/gem-injector/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)

It is built using [Java Reflection API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/package-summary.html) without any third-party libraries. Except for jUnit and Mockito, of course :) It is [Maven-based project](https://maven.apache.org) so if you are familiar with Maven you can copy it and build into .jar by yourself.

It doesn’t have complicated and elaborated architecture, hundreds of features and so on, it is intended to be used in simple home or so called “pet” projects that do not require excessive complexity.

I will be happy if you will find this container useful for your apps.
